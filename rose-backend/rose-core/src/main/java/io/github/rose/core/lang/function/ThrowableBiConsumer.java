/**
 * Represents an operation that accepts two input arguments and returns no result,
 * potentially throwing a {@link Throwable}. This is the two-arity specialization of
 * {@link ThrowableConsumer}.
 *
 * <p>Additionally, this interface provides a default method ({@link #andThen}) to support
 * chaining operations, similar to functional constructs in the JDK.
 *
 * <h3>Example Usage</h3>
 * <pre>{@code
 * ThrowableBiConsumer<Integer, Integer> addAndPrint = (a, b) -> {
 *     int sum = a + b;
 *     System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);
 * };
 *
 * addAndPrint.accept(3, 5); // Output: Sum: 8
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h3>Error Handling Example</h3>
 * <pre>{@code
 * ThrowableBiConsumer<String, Integer> parseAndPrint = (str, radix) -> {
 *     int value = Integer.parseInt(str, radix);
 *     System.out.println("Parsed value: " + value);
 * };
 *
 * try {
 *     parseAndPrint.accept("123", 10); // Output: Parsed value: 123
 *     parseAndPrint.accept("abc", 16); // May throw NumberFormatException
 * } catch (Throwable t) {
 *     System.err.println("Error occurred: " + t.getMessage());
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * @param <T> the type of the first argument to the operation
 * @param <U> the type of the second argument to the operation
 * @author <a href="mailto:ichensoul@gmail.com">chensoul</a>
